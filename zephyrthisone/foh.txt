[2;34mXbox 360 Slim False overheat issue...[0m
```

**Are you experiencing false overheat on your 360 slim?**

**How to identify a false overheat?**

If your Xbox immediately overheats only a second or two after powering on you most likely have a false overheat, Normal overheats typically happen much slower in a span of 30-60 seconds after startup combined with the fans gradually speeding up till the overheat RROD happens.

**Why is this happening?**

When microsoft was manufacturing corona through waitsburg motherboards* they used resistors prone to failing in certain places on the motherboard including the bridge for the thermal signals.

**How can i tell if i have a corona/waitsburg motherboard?**

You can without even opening your console, Take a look on the rear of the xbox directly above the av port there is an amperage rating - You should see 12v followed by either 9.6A or 10.83A, If you see 9.6A you have a corona/waitsburg, If you see 10.83 you have a trinity which is not a good thing meaning you may have a faulty gpu instead.

**How do i fix it?**

First off, You need to have soldering equipment and experience is highly suggested before trying this repair, However in the world of xbox 360 repairs this one is fairly simple,
You will need to locate the thermal sensor bridge resistors as shown in the image and follow the instructions on the image and check the row of resistors with a multimeter to insure they are all 0 ohm.
If they are all 0 ohm this tutorial wont help you, however if one or two or more are NOT 0 ohm you will heat the affected resistors with a soldering iron and remove them, you will then bridge them with some solder,
theoretically after that the false overheat issue is fixed, Attempt to boot your Xbox and it should be fixed!

***ONLY ATTEMPT THIS REPAIR IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCED AND ARE 100% CERTAIN YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT DAMAGING THE XBOX FURTHER.***
