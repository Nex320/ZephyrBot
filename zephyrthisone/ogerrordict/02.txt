Cause: EEPROM check failed. You may have flashed something wrong or caused a short somewhere on your motherboard (possibly while soldering).

Solution: If youâ€™re using a modchip and you just flashed it, try again using a different BIOS. If you recently did some soldering to your Xbox, check for any stray solder balls that may be present and carefully remove them.

``Additional info: This error is triggered by the bootloader and as a result does not display an error code on screen. You will see the Xbox rebooting and flashing red and green lights (FRAG).``
